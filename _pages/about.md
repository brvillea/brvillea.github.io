## About me
From January 2026, I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/math/Pages/default.aspx) at Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg. My supervisor is [Hannes Thiel](http://hannesthiel.org/), and my research focuses on operator algebras.

I am interested in noncommutative geometry, C\*-algebras, and Hilbert C\*-modules.
