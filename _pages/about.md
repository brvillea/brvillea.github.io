### About me
From January 2026, I am a doctoral student in mathematics at the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/math/Pages/default.aspx) at Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg. My supervisor is [Hannes Thiel](http://hannesthiel.org/), and the research project focuses on the structure theory of operator algebras.
