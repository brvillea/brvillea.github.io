### About me
From January 2026, I am a doctoral student in mathematics at the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/math/Pages/default.aspx) at Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg. My supervisor is [Hannes Thiel](http://hannesthiel.org/), and the research project focuses on the structure theory of operator algebras.

My [research interests](research) include noncommutative geometry, C\*-algebras, and Hilbert C\*-modules.

I completed my master's degree in mathematics at the [University of Bonn](https://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/en/welcome) in Germany, and I received my bachelor's degree from the [Autonomous University of Aguascalientes](https://www.uaa.mx/portal/) in Mexico. For details, see my [CV](curriculum).
